# ConditionalStatements
This tutorial will cover If, Else, Elif, and nested.

## If Statements: 
If you are looking at the specfic impulse of rocket fuel. In this case you have a specific impulse of 289 Isp.

```python
if specific_impulse != 289:
    print("This is less than or greater than specific impulse that the engine needs.")
```

## Else Statement:
If the specific impulse does not meet the required if statement the following command will be printed. 

```python
else:
    print("Fuel type needed for a 289 Specific Impulse is Kerosene")
```

## Elif Statement:
